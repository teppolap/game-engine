# OpenGL Game Engine Programming Project


## Overview

This is a 'minimum dependency' game engine. There are gazillion engines, libraries and frameworks that can do this automatically with much less code, but this projects principle was to gain proper understanding of the required inner workings. In real life though, it does not make much sense to do everything from the scratch. The 'Engine' parts are included in 'core' folder of the project. This includes a snapshot copy of the glm math library and stb-image for texture loading. In real world, the engine bits should be built into its own library.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Understanding Core Concepts:** Solid understanding of fundamental concepts related to game engine development, including the game loop, graphics pipeline, input handling, physics simulation, audio playback, scripting, and asset management.

- **Game Engine Architectures:** Various game engine architectures, design patterns, and optimization techniques. Understanding the importance of efficient and scalable solutions in game development.

- **Develop Games Using Engine:** Develop games using the game engine. Experiencing the entire game development pipeline, from engine design to game implementation.
